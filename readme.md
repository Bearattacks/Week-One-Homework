# Week One Homework

## A Couple of things I did differently:
* Didn’t create a XIB, I wanted to try doing the layout programmatically.
* I implemented the header with UILabel and images instead of one flat image. I just wanted the practice.
* I also used a scrollview, I wanted to try it out if that’s okay.

## Questions: 
* Is there a way to position images without modifying the width and height? I may have distorted the aspect ratio ever so slightly.
* I implemented rounded corners using QuartzCore, I figured this was the correct way to this?
* Programmatically, how do you determine the layering of the views? I was able to workaround an issue with the main post text by changing the background color to have 0 alpha.
