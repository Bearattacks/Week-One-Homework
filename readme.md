# Week One Homework

### Notes
* Didn’t create a XIB, I wanted to try doing the layout programmatically.
* I implemented the header with UILabel and images instead of one flat image. I just wanted the practice.
* I also used a scrollview, I wanted to try it out if that’s okay.
* I got really hung up on manually implementing attributedText, but I eventually found a  way to do it using ranges.
* Cocoapods was bugging out for me, I wasn’t able to get TTAttributed Label to style the link and make it clickable.
* I tried for the life of me to get the comment UIView to respond to keyboard height, but  I think there might have been some hierarchy issues that weren’t allowing me to manipulate the View I was using for the comment box.
