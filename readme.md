[✓] Add a container view and modify properties: backgroundColor, cornerRadius, font, textColor, shadowOffset.

[✓] Add buttons with different images for default and highlighted.

[✓] Add UIImageViews and choose the right mode: aspect fill, aspect fit, etc.

[✓] Add a UITextField with a background image.

[✓] Add UILabels with attributed text (instead of plain text), so that you can bold individual words.

[✓] Setup CocoaPods for managing 3rd party libraries and use TTTAttributedLabel to style the link and make it clickable. 

[] Optional: Move the textfield when the keyboard appears (so close!)

[] Optional: Configure the autoresizingMasks to support rotation

[✓] Optional: Implement the same page programatically without using Interface Builder.
